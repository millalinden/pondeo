# GitHub 

Branches
Naming: Use prefixes (feat, fix, docs) before the specific commit comment. Branch name should explain what the branch do.
"feat:  button component - Milla"
"fix:   button component - Milla"

When creating new branch, always pull down the latest main.
Daily stand-up where we merge commits to main. 
Never work in main and do not merge unless everyone agrees.

# Components & Pages

Naming: Make it clear what it is and use uppercase.

# Functions & Variables

Naming: Use Camelcase
Only use arrow functions when necessary.

# TailwindCss

When provided with design and styling from UX create custom styles in tailwind.config file

# SEO & Accessibility

Use Semantic tags

aria-labels

# Comments

Add a comment above every component or function describing it.
Use this for longer comments:
/*

 */

# Tests

We will work with Github Actions to automate testing and have a pipeline for CI/CD
